# BioDiversity_Data_Analysis
 Data Analysis and Visualization of BioDiversity Dataset
# Introduction 
biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations

My Questions to seek:
- What is the percentage of each conservation_status for species
- How each category is distributed into conservation_status
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant
- Which animal is most prevalent and what the distribution for this animal is across each park

**Data sources:**

Both `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).

Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional.

### Analysis

In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: 

1. Distributions
1. counts(sum)
1. relationship between species with chi_2
1. conservation status of species
1. observations of species in parks.
